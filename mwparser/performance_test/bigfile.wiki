= Running ALPS programs using Python = 

To demonstrate the use of ALPS from Python we will look at a simple classical Monte Carlo simulation, similar to the second MC tutorial [[ ALPS_2_Tutorials:MC-02_Susceptibilities | second MC tutorial ]].

= Launching Python =

Python restricts Python extensions to be used only with the '''exact''' version of Python used to compile the extension and no other. If you build ALPS from source, as it is required for example on Linux, you can specify the Python interpreter to use when configuring ALPS. ALPS will then create a script called

 alpspython

which sets the paths needed to find the ALPS extensions and then calls your Python interpreter.

If, on the other hand, you install the binary ALPS package for MacOS or Windows you will need to download and install also Vistrails since the ALPS packages were built against the Python interpreter shipped with Vistrails. To do so call

 vispython

You might wonder why we require you to install a big package like Vistrails even if you should not want to use Vistrails. The reason is that most of the contents of the Vistrails application are libraries and Python modules that we need anyway for ALPS. If we were to prepare an ALPS installer that did not rely on Vistrails it would be nearly as big as Vistrails!

= Detailed instructions =

== Importing the ALPS modules ==

After launching Python import the modules we will need:

 import pyalps
 import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
 import pyalps.plot

The full Python script is in the tutorials directory at [http://alps.comp-phys.org/static/tutorials2.1.0/intro-01-basics/tutorial-full.py  tutorials/intro-01-basics/tutorial-full.py ]

== Preparing the input ==

To prepare the input we create a Python lust of dicts containing the simulation parameters:

<source lang="python">
parms = []
for t in [1.5,2,2.5]:
   parms.append(
       { 
         'LATTICE'        : "square lattice", 
         'T'              : t,
         'J'              : 1 ,
         'THERMALIZATION' : 1000,
         'SWEEPS'         : 100000,
         'UPDATE'         : "cluster",
         'MODEL'          : "Ising",
         'L'              : 8
       }
   )
</source>


We next write the input files for the ALPS simulation:

 input_file = pyalps.writeInputFiles('parm1',parms)

The argument 'parm1' tells the function to use parm1 as prefix for all simulation files. The function returns the name of the main simulation file (here 'parm1.in.xml').

== Running the simulation ==

===  Running the simulation on a serial machine  ===

To run the simulation we just call the runApplication function:

 pyalps.runApplication('spinmc',input_file,Tmin=5,writexml=True)

The parameter writexml=True tells ALPS to write all results also to the XML files. This slows down the I/O but is convenient since it allows you to look at the results simply by opening the output XML files in your web browser. However, if you measure many quantities the files will become huge and writing will take too long.

===  Running the simulation on a parallel machine  ===

To run the simulation on a parallel machine using MPI, call the following command instead:

 pyalps.runApplication('spinmc',input_file,Tmin=5,writexml=True,MPI=4)

where the argument MPI tells MPI how many processes to start.

== Loading the simulation results ==
=== Getting the result files ===

Before loading the results we need to get the list of result files. Looking only at files theta we created just now (those starting with the prefix parm1) we get the file list:

<source lang="python">
result_files = pyalps.getResultFiles(prefix='parm1')
print result_files
</source>

=== Loading the results ===

Next we might want to know what has been measured. For that we can load the  list of observables:

 print pyalps.loadObservableList(result_files)

We decide to load the absolute value and square of the magnetization, nd print what we loaded:

 data = pyalps.loadMeasurements(result_files,['|Magnetization|','Magnetization^2'])
 print data

The printed output contains the loaded values in y, and all the simulation parameters in the dict called props.

== Plotting the results ==

To make a plot of, e.g. |Magnetization| versus temperature we now collect the values of |Magnetization| into y and the temperature T into x using a call to collectXY:

 plotdata = pyalps.collectXY(data,'T','|Magnetization|')

=== Plotting in Python using matplotlib ===
and then we plot it using [http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/ matplotlib] and the pyalps.plot module:

<source lang="python">
plt.figure()
pyalps.plot.plot(plotdata)
plt.xlim(0,3)
plt.ylim(0,1)
plt.title('Ising model')
plt.show()
</source>

=== Converting to other formats ===

We can also call functions to convert the dataset to other plot formats, such as text, grace, or gnuplot:

<source lang="python">
print pyalps.plot.convertToText(plotdata)
print pyalps.plot.makeGracePlot(plotdata)
print pyalps.plot.makeGnuplotPlot(plotdata)
</source>

== Evaluating data ==

We can easily evaluate functions of the results, e.g. to caluclate the Binder cumulant ratio <math> \langle m^2 \rangle / \langle |m|\rangle ^2 </math>. We create a new DataSet and fill it in:

<source lang="python">
binder = pyalps.DataSet()
binder.props = pyalps.dict_intersect([d[0].props for d in data])
binder.x = [d[0].props['T'] for d in data]
binder.y = [d[1].y[0]/(d[0].y[0]*d[0].y[0]) for d in data]
print binder
</source>

The expression d[1].y[0]/(d[0].y[0]*d[0].y[0]) uses jackknife-analysis to calculate correct Monte Carlo error bars for the correlated quantities. 

Finally we make another plot:

<source lang="python">
plt.figure()
pyalps.plot.plot(binder)
plt.xlabel('T')
plt.ylabel('Binder cumulant')
plt.show()
</source>
